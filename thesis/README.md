# Ball on a beam - thesis

This repository contains my MSc Thesis files.
The Thesis itself is in Polish, but other resources should be
in English.

## Engineering Master's project

The main repository of my work is available at
[@pbanaszkiewicz/msc-thesis](https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/msc-thesis).

## Compilation

You can create a `main.pdf` containing the Thesis with following command:

```bash
$ make pdf
```

To remove all the debris from LaTeX use `make clean`.

## Credits

LaTeX class for AGH-UST specific representation of the Thesis was made by
M. Szpyrka and others (see `aghdpl.cls` for more).
